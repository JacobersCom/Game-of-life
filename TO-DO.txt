Fix save and open

Open - have it work with any grid size. When you opena 30 by 30 grid it should resize to that gridsize
Save - needs to save to a pre living file and if that file doesnt exist act as save as. 
Grid lines
Add differe icons for play and etc
Add a save, new, and open icon instead of it living in the files menu bar
