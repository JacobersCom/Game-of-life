# ConWay's Game of life

ðŸ”§ The Basics: How It Works
Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is a grid-based simulation where cells can be either:

Alive (1)

Dead (0)

The grid evolves frame by frame (generation by generation) based on a fixed set of rules. Itâ€™s deterministicâ€”no randomnessâ€”but the patterns that emerge? Wild.

Each cell interacts with its 8 neighbors (adjacent horizontally, vertically, and diagonally), and the state of each cell in the next generation depends on how many live neighbors it has.

## WHy Build this?
Algorithms: Teaches efficient use of 2D arrays, buffer swapping, and state tracking.
Simulation Thinking: It's a mental shiftâ€”focus on rules, not instructions.
Emergent Gameplay: Itâ€™s the foundation of thinking like a systems designer.
